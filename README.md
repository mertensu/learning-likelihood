# Learning the Likelihood: Using DeepInference for the Estimation of Diffusion-Model and Lévy Flight Parameters (Voss, Mertens, Radev)
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for training of the diffusion and lévy flight model on both clean and contaminated data. There are two$
additional folders named _img_ and _model\_checkpoints_ with the latter containing a pretrained network.

The datasets used for the training of the models can be downloaded from the following link:

There is one zip-file for each example, containing the training set and the test set. The Jupyter Notebooks assum$
you have the data in a folder named _data_ on the same level as the two folders _model\_checkpoints_ and _img_.

Please make sure to unzip the content of the respective zip-file into the _data_ folder you created.
